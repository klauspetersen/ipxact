IPXACT to VHDL package and C header

This python script will take an IP-XACT file and output the memory-map data in a C header and a VHDL package. This means that you can use the IP-XACT document as your master document for your memory-map. This should help avoid bugs stemming from missing synchronization between the expected memory-map seen from the Processor and the memory-map used in your IP-core.
